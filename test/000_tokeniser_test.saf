gobbet square taking A giving B:
  make B = A * A;
  end gobbet;

# A Gobbet that'll take a number and raise it to the power of exponent.
gobbet power taking number, exponent giving result:
  make result = number;
  make times_count = 1;
  while times_count < exponent, called power loop;
    make result = result * number;
    make times_count = times_count + 1;
    end while power loop;

print "The square of 4 is " + implement square with A = 4;
print "The square of 5 is " + implement square with A = 5;
print "Raising 3 to the power of 4 is " + implement power with number = 3, exponent = 4;

make does_not_ãƒ„_look_like_a_smiley = 4;

make A = 43;
make B = 3.4;
