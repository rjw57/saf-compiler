# A Gobbet that'll take a number and raise it to the power of exponent.
gobbet power taking number only a number, exponent only a number giving result only a number:
  make result = number;
  make times_count = 1;
  while times_count < exponent, called power loop:
    make result = result * number;
    make times_count = times_count + 1;
    end while power loop;
  end gobbet;

gobbet square_noret taking A:
  make B = A * A;
  end gobbet;

gobbet square taking A giving B:
  make B = A * A;
  end gobbet;

gobbet nop:
  make C = 4;
  end gobbet;

implement nop;
implement square_noret with A = 4;
implement square_noret with A = 5;

make X = 4;
make Y = 3;
make B = 6;
print "The square of " + X + " is " + implement square with A = X;
print (X + 1) + " raised to the power of " + Y + " is " +
	implement power with exponent = Y, number = X + 1;
